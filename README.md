# supercoders_phase1
### Supercoders is a set of B.Tech Students identified by our GIET University and EZ Trainings, who are capable of Basic as well as Intermediate Coding and require advanced programming trainings to help them Crack Product Based Companies
<br></br>
### The training is divided into 3 Phases, 
<ul>
 <li> Phase 1 - Basic and Intermediate Coding (36 Hours) </li>
 <li> Phase 2 - Data Structures and Algorithm (42 Hours) </li>
